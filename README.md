# OWP Snow17 Model Version for NextGen

**Description**:  

Snow17 is a snow accumulation and melt model that has been used by the National Weather Service since the late 1970s for operational streamflow 
forecasting.  It is a temperature-index model that was first described in Anderson (1973) before being incorporated into the NWS River Forecasting System (NWSRFS) and more recently the NWS Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS).  The version of the Snow17 model maintained in this directory is formulated from original NWS FORTRAN code to be compatible with 
the NextGen simulation and forecasting framework. 

  - **Technology stack**: The model code is written in FORTRAN with a driver that incorporates Basic Model Interface (BMI) commands to enable Snow17 to be run as a module within the NextGen framework. 
  is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.  It has been compiled using gnu, pgi and intel compilers. 
  - **Status**: pre-Beta (still in initial development)
  - **Links**:  This code was adapted from source code included in https://github.com/NCAR/NWS_hydro_models -- a version used in federally-funded streamflow forecasting research at NCAR. The original source code for that effort was obtained from the NWS Office of Hydrology around 2013.

  be expressed in a sentence or two.
